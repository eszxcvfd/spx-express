/**
 * TDD Test: Verify P01 API route paths match frontend expectations.
 *
 * The frontend module p01Api (fe/src/services/api.ts) calls these paths:
 *   GET    /orders/orders           → list
 *   GET    /orders/orders/:id       → detail
 *   POST   /orders/orders           → create
 *   POST   /orders/orders/:id/send-to-accounting
 *   POST   /orders/orders/:id/confirm-accounting
 *   POST   /orders/orders/:id/send-to-director
 *   POST   /orders/orders/:id/approve
 *   POST   /orders/orders/:id/reject
 *   POST   /orders/orders/:id/send-to-supplier
 *   POST   /orders/orders/:id/supplier-response
 *   DELETE /orders/orders/:id       → cancel
 *   POST   /orders/orders/:id/complete
 *
 * The backend mounts order routes at /orders.
 * This test verifies that ALL :id-based routes include the /orders prefix
 * so the frontend paths resolve correctly.
 *
 * Bug: routes like /:id resolve to /orders/:id but frontend calls /orders/orders/:id
